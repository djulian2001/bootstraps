library file bootstraps

Description:
	This is a script that takes in command line args and sets up an ansible 
	controller node.  Following the instructions from the ansible docs we will
	be using the pip install method.

	Why pip?
		Pip will have the latest core modules.
		The source code will not have been changed and module behavior should
			follow the docs
		Its very easy to do
		If down the road, ansible versions have to be coupled to deployments we
			can easily manage ansible versions using python module virtualenv 
			and the virtualenv wrapper 

Expected Results:
	The ansible tool will be installed.
	The deployment user (normally ansible) will be created on the control server
	The deployment user will be given sudo privileges on the control server 
		- file: /etc/sudoers
	The deployment user will be created on all of the remote hosts
	The deployment user will be given sudo privileges using the /etc/sudoers file
	The deployment

user scope:
	This script has to be run by a user with sudo privileges.
	The user has to have sudo privileges on the remote hosts.

bootstrap dependencies:
	sshpass
	epel

ansible dependencies:
	python-pip 
	python-devel 
	openssl-devel.x86_64

other dependencies:
